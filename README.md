# Tech Stack
**React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS**

I used Vite to bootstrap this project because it's fast to develop with and has a well documented plugin API with useful plugins, like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite).
I included Tailwind CSS because I wanted to use a CSS library I'm familiar with that provides utility classes for quick prototyping.

From Vite README:
> This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
